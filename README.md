# Diaspora Native WebApp

This is an unofficial client developed just for the lulz.

### Native
It's "native" because it's developed in Java + the Android SDK (Android Studio).
Other Diaspora clients are developed using frameworks like AppCelerator Titanium. A native app will always be more efficient and almost certainly be faster and make better use of the resources of the device.

### "WebApp"
It's a WebApp because at this moment Diaspora doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the user's data, publications, direct messages and so on, that's why there are only WebApps for Diaspora out there.

### System Requirements

For the moment, the minimum supported version of Android is Lolipop (Android 5.0.1, or API 21) but I'll try to broaden the backward compatibility at least back to KitKat (Android 4.0.3 or API 15).

### Permissions

It only requires Internet access.
